Checklist
=======

A rails application that exercises jQuery and Ajax to refine a checklist application.

Setup
=======

Run these commands to try it out.

```
bundle
rake db:setup
rails s
```

Requires Ruby 1.9.2 or later to run.

Credits
=======

This starts with the RailsCast #136 sample application and walks me through jQuery and Ajax changes to improve
the application.  I really like having this app around as I find it personally useful as well as a good exercise.
